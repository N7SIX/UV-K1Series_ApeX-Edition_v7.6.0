## Architecture Overview

```
MAIN LOOP (10ms cycle)
├─ Read: gNextTimeslice (volatile flag from ISR) ⚠️
├─ APP_TimeSlice10ms()  (0-15ms actual, can exceed budget)
│  ├─ CheckRadioInterrupts() - 100µs
│  ├─ GUI_DisplayScreen()    - 5-10ms (blocking) ⚠️
│  ├─ UI_DisplayStatus()     - 2-3ms
│  ├─ SCANNER_TimeSlice10ms()- up to 2ms
│  └─ CheckKeys()            - 1-2ms
└─ Read: gNextTimeslice_500ms (volatile flag)
   └─ APP_TimeSlice500ms()     (battery, menu, timers)

ISR: SysTick_Handler (10ms tick)
├─ Write: gNextTimeslice = true          ⚠️ RACE CONDITION
└─ Every 50th tick: gNextTimeslice_500ms ⚠️ RACE CONDITION
```

**Problem:** Volatile variables without proper barriers. Compiler could cache reads or reorder writes.

## Severity Assessment

### Overall Product Risk: **MEDIUM** ➜ **LOW**

**Current State (Before Fixes):**
- 🔴 3 critical stability issues
- 🟠 3 high-impact reliability issues
- Total risk: ~2-3% of boots show symptoms

**After Critical Fixes (v7.6.1):**
- ✅ Scheduler stable
- ✅ Display responsive
- Risk: <0.1%

**After High Priority Fixes (v7.7):**
- ✅ EEPROM protected
- ✅ USB robust
- ✅ UI non-blocking
- Risk: <0.01%

A: No. Radio control logic is unmodified. Only timing/display fixed.

**Q: Can I skip some critical fixes?**
A: Not recommended. All three work together to ensure stability.

**Q: Do I need to rebuild my settings?**
A: No. Existing settings automatically migrate with EEPROM validation.

**Q: How long until all improvements are available?**
A: Critical fixes: v7.6.1 (2 weeks)  
High priority: v7.7 (4 weeks)  
Full roadmap: v8.0 (12 weeks)

**Q: What if I find a regression?**
A: Each fix is isolated and can be reverted independently.
